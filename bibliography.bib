abstract="In chapters 2--7, I covered geo web apps and hybrid apps. This chapter introduces the third part of the book, in which I talk about native iOS geographic apps. There are two main ingredients for creating a native geo app in iOS: location services and maps. Location services are provided by the Core Location framework, which make available methods to obtain information about the user's location and direction. Maps are provided by the Map Kit framework, which until iOS 5.1, used the Google Mobile Maps service to provide map data. Starting with iOS 6, it uses the Apple Maps cartography recently introduced. (This is the same map data used by the Maps app in iOS 6.)",

abstract="It is held as a truism that deep neural networks require large datasets to train effective models. However, large datasets, especially with high-quality labels, can be expensive to obtain. This study sets out to investigate (i) how large a dataset must be to train well-performing models, and (ii) what impact can be shown from fractional changes to the dataset size. A practical method to investigate these questions is to train a collection of deep neural answer selection models using fractional subsets of varying sizes of an initial dataset. We observe that dataset size has a conspicuous lack of effect on the training of some of these models, bringing the underlying algorithms into question.",
